blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - brand_colors_only_for_accent: Used brand blue (#3A90C8, #076AAC) for cyan/blue only, kept functional colors (red/green/yellow) standard
  - charcoal_background: Used --charcoal (#0d1117) as background for dark premium feel
  - manual_activation: User must manually set color scheme in WT settings (no auto-default)

findings:
  - wt_settings_has_comments: Windows Terminal settings.json supports // comments, need to strip before parsing
  - schemes_array: Color schemes go in "schemes" array in WT settings

worked:
