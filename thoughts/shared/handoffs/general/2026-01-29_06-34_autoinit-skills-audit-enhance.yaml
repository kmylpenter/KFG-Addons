status: complete
outcome: SUCCEEDED

goal: Audit, fix, and enhance autoinit-skills addon (loop, implement_plan, session-init, never-ask-continue)
now: Skills are deployed to ~/.claude/ - test them in real sessions to validate enforcement works
test: head -7 ~/.claude/skills/loop/SKILL.md  # should show v1.5

done_this_session:
  - task: Audited 4 skill files (new vs original versions)
    files: [addons/autoinit-skills/backup-originals/loop-v1.3.md, addons/autoinit-skills/backup-originals/implement_plan-v2.1.md, addons/autoinit-skills/backup-originals/session-init-v4.4.md, addons/autoinit-skills/backup-originals/never-ask-continue-original.md]
  - task: Fixed loop v1.4 (was missing ~70% content) - created v1.5 by merging EXECUTION GATES + full v1.3 content
    files: [addons/autoinit-skills/files/.claude/skills/loop/SKILL.md]
  - task: Enhanced all 3 skills with Quick Start, Compaction Recovery, Progress Reporting, Integration Chain
    files: [addons/autoinit-skills/files/.claude/skills/loop/SKILL.md, addons/autoinit-skills/files/.claude/skills/implement_plan/SKILL.md, addons/autoinit-skills/files/.claude/skills/session-init/SKILL.md]
  - task: Deployed all files to global ~/.claude/
    files: [~/.claude/skills/loop/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/implement_plan/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/skills/session-init/SKILL.md, ~/.claude/rules/never-ask-continue.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Real-world validation needed - do EXECUTION GATES actually prevent premature stopping?
  - Should loop v1.5 be further trimmed for token efficiency (1343 lines is large)?

decisions:
  - merged_not_replaced: loop v1.5 combines v1.4 EXECUTION GATES with full v1.3 content instead of choosing one approach
  - additive_enhancements: implement_plan and session-init got additions at end, no original content removed
  - version_bumped_loop_only: Only loop got version bump (1.4→1.5) since it had structural changes

findings:
  - loop_stripped_too_much: v1.4 was created by stripping v1.3 too aggressively - lost agent prompts, state schemas, examples, pseudocode
  - other_files_were_complete: implement_plan v2.2, session-init v4.5, never-ask-continue all preserved original content correctly
  - execution_gates_pattern: GATE 1 (before work) + GATE 2 (checkpoint) + GATE 3 (before ending) pattern is consistent across all 3 skills

worked:
  - Comparing line counts immediately reveals content loss (358 vs 1159 lines)
  - Reading both versions side-by-side identifies exact missing sections
  - Adding enhancements at end of file preserves original content safely

failed:
  - Previous session's aggressive rewrite of loop (v1.3→v1.4) lost critical content

next:
  - Test /loop solve in a real session to verify EXECUTION GATES prevent early stopping
  - Test /session-init to verify EXECUTION GATES work during interview phase
  - Consider creating automated tests for skill completeness (compare section headers)
  - Update addon.json version if needed
