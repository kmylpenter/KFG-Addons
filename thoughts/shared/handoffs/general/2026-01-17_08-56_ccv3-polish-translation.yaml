goal: Created CCv3 Polish Translation addon with 853 keywords for skill activation
now: Install addon by copying skill-rules.json to ~/.claude/skills/

test: cd "D:\Projekty DELL KG\KFG-Addons\addons\ccv3-polish-translation" && python test-polish-prompts.py

done_this_session:
  - task: Ran /premortem to identify risks before modifying CCv3 skill-rules.json
    files: []
  - task: Created addon structure with addon.json, README.md
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/addon.json, addons/ccv3-polish-translation/README.md]
  - task: Built curated Polish keyword dictionary (v2) with 530 skill-specific keywords
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/polish-keywords-v2.json]
  - task: Analyzed 5934 user prompts to discover actual keyword usage patterns
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/analyze-user-prompts.py, addons/ccv3-polish-translation/prompt-analysis-results.json]
  - task: Added discovered keywords from prompt analysis (+75 keywords)
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/add-discovered-keywords.py, addons/ccv3-polish-translation/polish-keywords-v2-enriched.json]
  - task: Added ASCII variants for all Polish words (sprawdz = sprawdź) - handles typing without diacritics
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/add-ascii-variants.py, addons/ccv3-polish-translation/polish-keywords-v3.json]
  - task: Generated final skill-rules.json with 853 Polish keywords (70 skills + 6 agents)
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/apply-translations-v3.py, addons/ccv3-polish-translation/files/skills/skill-rules.json]
  - task: Created test suite with 35 test cases (all passing)
    files: [addons/ccv3-polish-translation/test-polish-prompts.py]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - direct_merge_over_separate_file: User preferred merging Polish keywords directly into skill-rules.json rather than a separate overlay file
  - ascii_variants_required: Discovered user often types without Polish diacritics (pamietaj vs pamiętaj), so both versions needed
  - curated_over_automatic: V1 used automatic word matching which added too many generic words (w, z, do) - V2/V3 uses manually curated keywords per skill

findings:
  - skill_rules_has_76_entries: skill-rules.json has 70 skills + 6 agents (NOT 109 as initially stated)
  - user_types_without_diacritics: Analysis of 5934 prompts showed frequent use of ASCII variants (pamietaj 65x, dzialaj 60x, sprobuj 50x)
  - top_commands: dodaj (152x), zaktualizuj (139x), kontynuuj (84x), zweryfikuj (76x) are most used Polish imperatives

worked:
  - Curated per-skill keywords instead of generic word replacement
  - Adding both Polish (ą,ć,ę) and ASCII (a,c,e) variants
  - Analyzing actual user prompt history for real-world keyword discovery

failed:
  - V1 automatic matching added too many generic words causing false triggers

next:
  - Install addon: Copy-Item files/skills/skill-rules.json ~/.claude/skills/skill-rules.json
  - Test in live session with Polish prompts
  - Consider adding Polish translations to skill prompt.md files (scope 2 from user)
