goal: Fix critical multi-device workflow bugs in EOS and migrate addons
now: Test /eos on StriX to verify mandatory steps execute correctly

test: /eos test-session && check handoff created + history pushed

done_this_session:
  - task: Fixed migrateconvo skill - wrong paths, bash command
    files: [addons/migrateconvo/files/skills/migrateconvo/SKILL.md, addons/migrateconvo/install.ps1]
  - task: Fixed migrateconvo installer - wrong source path
    files: [addons/migrateconvo/install.ps1]
  - task: Removed redundant install.ps1 from addon (use addon.json only)
    files: [addons/migrateconvo/install.ps1]
  - task: Fixed EOS - mandatory /create_handoff (was asking, now does)
    files: [addons/eos/files/skills/eos/SKILL.md]
  - task: Fixed EOS - mandatory push Claude History with correct path
    files: [addons/eos/files/skills/eos/SKILL.md]
  - task: Fixed EOS - git pull --rebase before push (multi-terminal conflicts)
    files: [addons/eos/files/skills/eos/SKILL.md]
  - task: Fixed migrate_gui.py - prevent overwriting larger files
    files: [addons/migrateconvo/files/templates/scripts/migrate_gui.py]
  - task: Fixed migrate_gui.py - keep window open for multiple migrations
    files: [addons/migrateconvo/files/templates/scripts/migrate_gui.py]
  - task: Fixed install-addons.ps1 - dynamic project detection
    files: [install-addons.ps1]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Konwersacje z 23:00 wczoraj na StriX - czy zostaly wypushowane?

decisions:
  - mandatory_handoff: EOS must create handoff without asking - users forget
  - pull_rebase: Required before push to handle multi-terminal /eos
  - size_check_migrate: Don't overwrite larger files with smaller ones

findings:
  - skill_paths: Hardcoded device paths (StriX, kamil) broke cross-device
  - installer_mismatch: addon install.ps1 had different paths than addon.json
  - history_path: ~/.claude-history/ is the actual repo, not ~/.claude/projects/

worked:
  - MANDATORY wording in skill forces Claude to execute steps
  - Size comparison prevents accidental data loss in migration

failed:
  - Asking user about handoff - Claude skipped 3/3 times
  - ~/.claude/projects path - it's a junction, use ~/.claude-history/

next:
  - Test /eos on StriX device
  - Verify handoff created automatically
  - Verify history pushed correctly
  - Push missing conversations from StriX (23:00 sessions)
